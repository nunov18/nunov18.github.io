# Frogger Arcade Game

In a lovely sunny day _Jonh Doe_ decided to go to the river for a cold bath, but some wild bugs are in the way.
The goal is to help _Jonh Doe_ cross the grass into the river as many times the as you can until you lose all your lives. If you step on the poisonous bugs you lose a live. Every time you reach the water _Jonh Doe_ takes a **swim score** and the game resets him to the beginning.
